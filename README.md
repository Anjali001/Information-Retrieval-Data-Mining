# Information-Retrieval-Data-Mining

This repository contains my coursework submissions for module COMP0087 completed as a part of MSc Data Science and ML.

Coursework 1 : Without so much data everywhere, Information retrieval systems are very common nowadays. Efforts are being made to develop more accurate retrieval systems that give relevant results when a query is given. In this report, I'll mention how I approached the problem of making a information retrieval system that gives ranked results when a query is given. For this, I've used cosine similarity for vector space models and BM25 (probabilistic model). At last, I've made query-likelihood model using laplace smoothing, Lindstone correction, dirichlet smoothing and compared them.
